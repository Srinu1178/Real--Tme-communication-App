### Real-Time Communication & Collaboration App
This project is a multi-user video conferencing and collaboration tool designed to provide a secure and feature-rich platform for online meetings. The application supports real-time video calls, screen sharing, and collaborative features like a shared whiteboard and file sharing.

## Core Features
* Multi-user Video Calling: Utilizes WebRTC to establish secure, peer-to-peer connections for high-quality video and audio streams between multiple participants.

* Screen Sharing: Allows users to share their screen with other participants, facilitating presentations and collaborative work.

* File Sharing: Enables participants to securely share files with one another directly within the meeting interface.


* Collaborative Whiteboard: A shared, real-time drawing and writing surface for brainstorming, sketching ideas, and dynamic collaboration.

* Data Encryption: All media streams and data are encrypted to ensure the privacy and security of the communication.

* User Authentication: A secure authentication system is implemented to manage user access and permissions for creating and joining meetings.

## Technologies Used
# Frontend:

* Framework: A modern JavaScript framework such as React, Angular, or Vue.js to build a dynamic user interface.

* Styling: A CSS framework like Tailwind CSS or custom CSS for responsive and elegant design.

# Backend:

* Server: Node.js with the Express framework to handle API requests and serve the application.

* Real-Time Communication: Socket.io or Firebase for managing WebSocket connections to handle real-time events like chat messages, whiteboard updates, and signaling for WebRTC.

* Database: A NoSQL database like Firebase Firestore to store user data, meeting details, and shared files.

* Real-Time Media:

* WebRTC: The primary technology for establishing and managing peer-to-peer video, audio, and data connections.

## Authentication & Security:

* Firebase Authentication: A robust service for user sign-up, sign-in, and session management.

* Encryption: Built-in end-to-end encryption provided by the WebRTC protocol for media streams.

## Project Goals
* Gain Experience: The project is a hands-on opportunity to gain experience in various technical areas, including:

* Frontend Development: Building a responsive and intuitive user interface.

* Backend Development: Creating a scalable server to manage real-time data.

* Media Streaming: Working with WebRTC for video and audio.

* Security: Implementing secure authentication and understanding data encryption.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the project locally.


Install dependencies:

``npm install``

## Configure environment variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your Firebase configuration and any other API keys required.

``REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key``
``REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain``
# ... other Firebase config

# Run the application:
Start the development server.

``npm start``

``The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.``

# Security & Data Handling
User authentication is handled by Firebase Auth, securing access to the application. Data, including chat messages and whiteboard updates, is stored in a Firestore database. Media streams via WebRTC are encrypted, ensuring that video and audio communication remains private between participants.
